# RoadRunned

This project is a docker image for PHP powered apps using RoadRunner and Alpine Linux.

## Why

- **Ubuntu based images are heavy**, Using in very simple cases, Ubuntu uses up to 15 times more storage space. _This images only uses ~100Mb._
- **NGINX with FPM is slow**, offers superior performance than a mixed configuration using the PHP process manager combined with Nginx as a TCP gateway.
